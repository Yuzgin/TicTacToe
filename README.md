# Tic Tac Toe Game README

## Overview
This Python script implements a console-based **Tic Tac Toe** game. The game supports single matches or "best of N" series between two players, where one chooses **X** and the other chooses **O**. Players take turns to mark positions on the board, and the game announces the winner after every match.

## How It Works

1. **Game Board Layout**:
   The board is represented as follows:
   ```
    1 | 2 | 3
   -----------
    4 | 5 | 6
   -----------
    7 | 8 | 9
   ```
   Players choose positions by inputting the corresponding number.

2. **Player Selection**:
   Players can choose between **X** or **O**. The game alternates turns automatically.

3. **Game Modes**:
   - **Single Match**: Play a single round.
   - **Best of N**: Play a series of games. N must be an odd number.

4. **Winning Conditions**:
   A player wins by marking three consecutive positions either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game announces the winner after every match.

5. **Tie Handling**:
   If no player wins and all positions are filled, the game declares a draw.

6. **Scoring**:
   The game tracks the number of wins for each player during the series.

7. **Play Again**:
   After a series ends, players can choose to start a new series or exit the game.
